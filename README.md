### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

&emsp;  Iâ€™m a software developer, specializing in the web and app development arena.<br> 
For the last 6 years, I have been developing web and mobile applications using <b>JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Vue.js, Python and Java</b> programming languages.<br>

&emsp;  Iâ€™m currently looking for a new position as a software developer. <br>
Iâ€™m hands on in all stages of the software development cycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment. No two days are the same for me; my tasks may involve analyzing algorithms, altering code, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas or integrating new systems.<br> <br>
&emsp; Something that I love about software development is the opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. The software development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as a person who loves to build new relationships, itâ€™s great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.
